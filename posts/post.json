        "content": "Viktor Gyokeres has added fuel to the rumors about a potential move to Arsenal this summer with some fresh comments after his latest heroics for Sporting Lisbon. The 26-year-old Swedish striker scored a crucial stoppage-time penalty to help Sporting come from behind to beat rivals Benfica in the Taça de Portugal final, in what could be a fitting farewell. That goal took his tally to an impressive 54 goals and 13 assists in 51 games this season, making him an obvious target for Arsenal, who’ve struggled to find the net consistently. Mikel Arteta’s side has been linked with Gyokeres since his time at Coventry City, and they’re reportedly among the top clubs in the race to sign the £60m-rated forward. When asked about his future after the Benfica match, Gyokeres said; “Let us see. It’s hard for me to say, because it is football and you never know what’s going to happen in the summer,” he told reporters. “So, for me to say anything else [other] than that is impossible. ”Pressed specifically about a possible move to Arsenal, he stayed focused on the present. “I don’t know, I just focus on this,” he said. “I’ve tried to focus on the last games because it’s so important and I don’t want to think about anything else. So yeah, if anything is true, let’s see in the summer.”"

        "content": "The Bianconeri have shifted their primary target after Victor Osimhen reportedly prefers a move to Saudi Arabia. Instead of the Nigerian striker, currently on loan at Galatasaray from Napoli, 'The Old Lady' has reportedly set their sights on Viktor Gyokeres, who is also being pursued by Arsenal. A summer revolution is brewing at Juventus, both on the bench, where Igor Tudor might refuse to stay for the Club World Cup if he isn't confirmed as head coach soon, and within the playing squad. The priority in the transfer market appears to be finding a solution at striker, a position that proved problematic last season. "

        "content": "Victor Osimhen makes history as the second African to score 25+ goals in a Turkish Süper Lig season, winning the golden boot and leading Galatasaray to their 25th league title. Nigeria’s Victor Osimhen has engraved his name in Turkish Super Lig history by becoming the second African player to score more than 25 goals in a single season, securing the league’s golden boot after an outstanding campaign on loan from SSC Napoli. Osimhen’s remarkable achievement places him alongside Senegalese striker Mbaye Diagne, who first reached this milestone during the 2018/2019 season by netting 30 goals in 29 matches for Kasimpasa and Galatasaray. The 26-year-old Nigerian forward scored 26 goals in 30 league appearances for Galatasaray this season, playing a pivotal role in leading the Lions to their record 25th league title. By reaching this landmark, Osimhen also became the third African player to win the Süper Lig golden boot, joining Morocco’s Aatif Chahechouche and Mbaye Diagne in this elite group."
